The purpose of this website is to help you gain the knowledge of growing your own food. There are many reasons why you may want to do this,
and they're all your own. It can seem daunting to create a food garden living in the city, but it's possible! Trust me: I do it myself!
This table will show you when to plant what. While this is not a complete list of what you can grow, all of these vegetables and fruits will grow well in a container.
<br>
The chart mentions that you can plant seeds indoors and then move them outside, or you can start them outside. The dates shown will tell you when it will be warm enough
to do this. If you plant seeds outside too soon, they may die if it gets too cold. The days to maturity will tell you how long you will be waiting
for your first harvest!
<br><br>
You'll need a few things to get yourself started:
<ul>
<li>Soil</li><br>
<li>Containers (anything from coffee cans to milk jugs to pickle buckets)</li><br>
<li>Seeds or starter plants</li><br>
<li>A sunny area</li>

</ul>
